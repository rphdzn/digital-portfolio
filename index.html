                Hello there! I am Raphael Dizon.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am a multimedia artist, focusing on graphic design, photography, branding, and illustrating.
                I look at the world through a creative lens. I aim to use my skills
                not only for my creative expression, but to help solve problems related
                to visual design.
